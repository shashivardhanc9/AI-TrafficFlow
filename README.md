### **🚀 Overview**  
Traffic congestion has become a major issue in urban areas, leading to **wasted time, fuel, and increased pollution**. Traditional traffic systems operate **on static timers**, causing unnecessary delays when lanes aren’t full.  

This project **uses AI to optimize traffic signals dynamically**, reducing wait times and ensuring smoother traffic flow. By analyzing **real-time traffic density** using **image processing**, the AI can **adapt signal timing on the fly**, minimizing congestion.  

---

## **⚠️ Problem Statement**
🚗 **Why do we need AI-driven traffic control?**  

- **Traditional traffic lights use fixed timers**, causing unnecessary waiting even when roads are empty.  
- **High congestion leads to longer travel times** and wasted fuel.  
- **Emergency vehicles get delayed**, affecting response time.  
- **Static traffic systems don’t adapt** to sudden changes in traffic flow.  

---

## **🚦 Existing Traffic Management Methods**
1️⃣ **Manual Control:** Traffic police manually direct traffic, requiring **high manpower** and leading to **delays in decision-making**.  
2️⃣ **Pre-Set Timer Systems:** Traffic signals work on **fixed timers**, failing to adjust based on **real-time congestion levels**.  
3️⃣ **Electronic Sensor Systems:** While better, these rely on **expensive sensors** that often have **accuracy issues**.  

### **🚨 Drawbacks of These Systems**  
❌ **Lack of real-time adaptability** → Traffic remains congested.  
❌ **Higher fuel consumption** → More pollution and increased travel costs.  
❌ **No prioritization for emergency vehicles** → Slower response times for ambulances & fire trucks.  

---

## **💡 Our AI-Based Solution**
Instead of relying on **static timers**, this AI-powered system:  

✔ **Uses real-time traffic data from cameras** to measure congestion.  
✔ **Dynamically adjusts signal timing** based on vehicle density.  
✔ **Prioritizes emergency vehicles** when detected in traffic.  
✔ **Reduces unnecessary waiting time** by optimizing green signal duration.  

**🎯 Goal:** To develop an **intelligent, fully automated traffic system** that ensures **faster movement, lower congestion, and better traffic flow**.

## **⚙️ How It Works**
1️⃣ **Capturing Live Traffic Feed**  
   📸 **CCTV cameras** at intersections capture real-time images.  

2️⃣ **Traffic Density Analysis**  
   🔍 AI **detects and counts vehicles** using **image recognition**.  

3️⃣ **Optimizing Signal Timings**  
   🤖 The AI **adjusts green light duration** based on real-time congestion.  

4️⃣ **Updating Traffic Signals Dynamically**  
   🚦 The system **automatically changes light durations** to reduce congestion.
